To complete the assignment, you’ll need to do the following:

1. Set up an Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data, replacing the existing RESTful API.

2. Modify the existing authentication middleware so that it works in the context of a GraphQL API.

3. Create an Apollo Provider so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server.

4. Deploy your application to Heroku with a MongoDB database using MongoDB Atlas. Use the [Deploy with Heroku and MongoDB Atlas](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mongodb/deploy-with-heroku-and-mongodb-atlas) walkthrough for instructions.


## User Story

```md
AS AN avid reader
I WANT to search for new books to read
SO THAT I can keep a list of books to purchase
```


## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a book search engine
WHEN I load the search engine
THEN I am presented with a menu with the options Search for Books and Login/Signup and an input field to search for books and a submit button

WHEN I click on the Search for Books menu option
THEN I am presented with an input field to search for books and a submit button

WHEN I am not logged in and enter a search term in the input field and click the submit button
THEN I am presented with several search results, each featuring a 

	book’s title, 
	author, 
	description, 
	image, and 
	a link to that book on the Google Books site

WHEN I click on the Login/Signup menu option
THEN a modal appears on the screen with a toggle between the option to log in or sign up

WHEN the toggle is set to Signup
THEN I am presented with three inputs for a username, an email address, and a password, and a signup button

WHEN the toggle is set to Login
THEN I am presented with two inputs for an email address and a password and login button

WHEN I enter a valid email address and create a password and click on the signup button
THEN my user account is created and I am logged in to the site

WHEN I enter my account’s email address and password and click on the login button
THEN I the modal closes and I am logged in to the site

WHEN I am logged in to the site
THEN the menu options change to Search for Books, an option to see my saved books, and Logout

WHEN I am logged in and enter a search term in the input field and click the submit button
THEN I am presented with several search results, 
	each featuring a 
	book’s title, 
	author, 
	description, 
	image, and 
	a link to that book on the Google Books site and 
	a button to save a book to my account

WHEN I click on the Save button on a book
THEN that book’s information is saved to my account

WHEN I click on the option to see my saved books
THEN I am presented with all of the books I have saved to my account, each featuring the 
	book’s title, 
	author, 
	description, 
	image, and 
	a link to that book on the Google Books site and 
	a button to remove a book from my account

WHEN I click on the Remove button on a book
THEN that book is deleted from my saved books list

WHEN I click on the Logout button
THEN I am logged out of the site and presented with a menu with the options Search for Books and Login/Signup and an input field to search for books and a submit button  
```

### Back-End Specifications

You’ll need to complete the following tasks in each of these back-end files:

* `server.js`: Implement the Apollo Server and apply it to the Express server as middleware.

* `auth.js`: Update the auth middleware function to work with the GraphQL API.

	**Hint**: Refer to the class activities as a refresher on how to do this.

* `Schemas` directory:
	* `resolvers.js`: Define the query and mutation functionality to work with the Mongoose models.
		**Hint**: Use the functionality in the `user-controller.js` as a guide.
	* `typeDefs.js`: Define the necessary `Query` and `Mutation` types:
		 * `Query` type:
			* `me`: Which returns a `User` type. -->
		* `Mutation` type:
			* `login`: Accepts an email and password as parameters; returns an `Auth` type.
			* `addUser`: Accepts a username, email, and password as parameters; returns an `Auth` type.
			* `saveBook`: Accepts a book author's array, description, title, bookId, image, and link as parameters; returns a `User` type. (Look into creating what's known as an `input` type to handle all of these parameters!)
			* `removeBook`: Accepts a book's `bookId` as a parameter; returns a `User` type.
		* `User` type:
			* `_id`
			* `username`
			* `email`
			* `bookCount`
			* `savedBooks` (This will be an array of the `Book` type.)
		* `Book` type:
			* `bookId` (Not the `_id`, but the book's `id` value returned from Google's Book API.)
			* `authors` (An array of strings, as there may be more than one author.)
			* `description`
			* `title`
			* `image`
			* `link`
		* `Auth` type:
			* `token`
			* `user` (References the `User` type.)


### Front-End Specifications

* `App.js`: Create an Apollo Provider to make every request work with the Apollo Server.
	



	<!-- GET HELP ON THIS PART -->
* `SearchBooks.js`:

	* Use the Apollo `useMutation()` Hook to execute the `SAVE_BOOK` mutation in the `handleSaveBook()` function instead of the `saveBook()` function imported from the `API` file.

	* Make sure you keep the logic for saving the book's ID to state in the `try...catch` block! 




	
<!-- GET HELP ON THIS PART -->
* `SavedBooks.js`:

	* Remove the `useEffect()` Hook that sets the state for `UserData`.

	* Instead, use the `useQuery()` Hook to execute the `GET_ME` query on load and save it to a variable named `userData`.

	* Use the `useMutation()` Hook to execute the `REMOVE_BOOK` mutation in the `handleDeleteBook()` function instead of the `deleteBook()` function that's imported from `API` file. (Make sure you keep the `removeBookId()` function in place!)

* `SignupForm.js`: Replace the `addUser()` functionality imported from the `API` file with the `ADD_USER` mutation functionality.

* `LoginForm.js`: Replace the `loginUser()` functionality imported from the `API` file with the `LOGIN_USER` mutation functionality.
